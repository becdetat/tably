Tably - PhoneGap app for viewing tabulature via Dropbox

> "I'm a concert pianist. That's a pretentious way of saying I'm... unemployed at the moment." <cite>-- An American in Paris<cite>

Since the dawn of time<sup>1</sup> players of music have stored their cache of illegally transcribed and downloaded tabulature on Dropbox and yearned - nay, tearfully longed - to be able to view said tabulature on their smart phone, tablet or similar device, with smarts like automatic scrolling, transposition and stopping the screen from turning off.

**Long no longer.** For Tably is... 

coming. Maybe.
